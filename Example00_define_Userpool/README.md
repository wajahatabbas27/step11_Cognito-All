## User Pool

The User pool depends for the signup in the application,
but the identity pool depends upon the external place to sign in the application , like Google,FaceBook
We can give all the parameters from the cdk as well so that we should go to the console to add the attributes
The attriutes are immutable so we need to be careful while creating the userpool
standard Attributes are immutable so they cannot be changed therefore we should be careful while creating them
Its the basic user pool that is created and we will signup by using this one , If we create it.
